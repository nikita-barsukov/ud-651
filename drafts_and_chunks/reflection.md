Most obvious problem with the research is that it does not contain any temporal aspect. Dataset covers only 2013. This would be crucial if I attempted to perform cause-and-effect analysis, and made my claims more justifiable.

Another obvious problem is that the dataset is limited only to two large cities: Chicago and Los Angeles. The reason for that is largele the availability of a dataset containing crime reports with geographical location. I couldn't find such data for several major US cities, for example New York City and Philadelphia.

A lot of effort was spent on normalizing and merging raw crime datasets. One of the tasks included normalizing crime types, making them uniform across all four datasets. I could make mistakes in attributing crime type reorted in original dataset to crime type used in this paper.
